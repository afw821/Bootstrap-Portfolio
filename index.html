                    two years and a Deputy Sheriff at Cherokee County, Ga for 3 1/2 years. I decided to make a career changee
                    and left my job as a Deputy and am currently attending Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp where I expect to
                    graduate in December 2018. I am currently seeking full-time employment in the technology field. In my
                    spare time I enjoy hanging out with my wife, my friends and my family. I enjoy watching Braves Baseball
                    and love college football. I enjoy traveling and anything involving the outdoors. Kayaking, hiking, camping,
                    fishing and mountain biking are among some of my favorite outdoor activities. I really enjoy music and
                    love going to concerts with friends. I can be contacted at afw821@gmail.com or you can fill out the form
